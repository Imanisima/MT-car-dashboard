### The Problem :bell:
Dealerships do not always have a functional filter for stick-shift cars. Even when the transmission filtering option is available, it is quite common that automatic cars are added to the results. This forces the user to double check that the car they are viewing is a manual **despite** using the filter or entering the keywords `manual transmission cars` into the searchbar.

### Technologies Used :basecampy:
* Python
* Flask
* Bootstrap
* Plotly Express

### Instructions for Running via Terminal üíª

* Open terminal
* Activate virtual env: `source venv/bin/activate`
* start server: `python app.py runserver`

__Note__: When you're done running the code, you're going to want to exit the virtual environment. To deactivate the virtual environment, just type: `deactivate` into the terminal.

### How to Use üìé
1. Once you have found a car listing that interests you, copy the VIN number
2. Go to the [Ancira](https://www.ancira.com) website or the indicated dealership site
3. Paste the VIN number into the search bar of the dealership
